[h1]Enable Cheats[/h1]


Enables the game's Cheat hotkeys.  Based on Steam user [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2333969105]dv's Cheatcodes mod[/url].

Press the Ctrl+] (Left control + right bracket) key to enable and disable the cheats.  Once enabled, use the Shift + <some key> to execute a cheat.

See the Cheat Keys section for the list of cheats.

[h2]Mod Differences[/h2]

This mod has a couple of differences from dv's:
[list]
[*]Does not require overwriting the game's original files.  This makes the mod more likely to be compatible with other mods.
[*]Uses a hotkey instead of the game's "magic text" to activate.
[*]Can be toggled on and off.
[/list]

[h1]Steam Workshop[/h1]

[h2]Cheats that Do Not Work[/h2]

Technical note:  There are some cheats that do not work because I was unable to find the prefab for ShowMutexes and onKeypressSpawnUiPrefab.

If anyone has a suggestion as to where they can be found, please let me know.
